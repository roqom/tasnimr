I just moved my WordPress blog to a static site, built using Jekyll. This is my first post after the migration.

I'm still getting used to this new way of blogging: writing in Markdown, working from the terminal, and managing Git. But I'm enjoying the learning process.

Jekyll feels simple on the surface. You can build a site quickly with few commands in the terminal. But once you look under the hood, there's a lot happening: configuration files, layouts, theme, Ruby and its gems, and more. Just read Jekyll's documentation.

For now, I'm sticking with the default Minima theme. It looks clean, and let me focus on writng before I dive deeper into customizing the site.
