I just moved my WordPress blog to a static site built with Jekyll. This is my first post after the change. 

I'm still getting used to this new way of blogging: writing in Markdown, working from the terminal, and managing Git. But I'm enjoying the learning process.

Jekyll feels simple on the surface. You can build a site quickly with few commands in the terminal. But once you look under the hood, there's a lot happening. Just take a look at its documentation. There are many things to know: configuration files, layouts, theme, Ruby and its gems, and more. 

For my blog theme, I'm using the default which is called Minima. For now I'm happy with it. It looks clean, and let me focus on writng before I dive deeper into customizing the site.
