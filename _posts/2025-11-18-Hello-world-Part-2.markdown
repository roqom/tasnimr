Here's to another "Hello world!"

I just moved my blog from WordPress to a static site build by Jekyll. So this is my first post after the migration.

I'm trying to get myself familiar with this new way of blogging without the WordPress CMS. I am in my terminal as I'm writing this post in markdown language.

From the outset it seems pretty straightforward to build a site with Jekyll. But as you read the documentation there are many things happening under the hood -- configuration, layout, theme, Ruby and its Gems, Git, etc. 

For a start, I will just use the default Jekyll theme Minima. I think it looks pretty good. But I plan to customize the look of my site  as I learn more about Jekyll.
