Self-reflection is important, even if it is just for one minute.

If you don’t reflect on your life, you tend to go through the motion of life without knowing where you are heading. Life is about growth. Self-reflection helps you find the key lessons you need to grow and not get stuck in life.

Here are the simple but powerful steps to get started:

### Step #1: Clear distraction ###

Self-reflection requires a clear mind. You can’t think effectively when you are distracted. 

So The first step is to find a time and place where you can’t be disturbed. 

When your mind is clear, you will be able to focus better.

### Step#2: Have an aim ###

What is one positive thing that you want to achieve in life?

Focus on that thing.

The goal doesn’t have to be big. 

If you don’t know your goal, think of a tiny positive thing you can do. 

Example of a tiny aim: I want to walk 10 mins every morning for 1 month.

### Step#3: Ask this key question ###

At the end of the day, ask yourself: 

"Am I moving closer to my goal or further away from it?"

If yes, cross out the day on your calendar or put a check on your list or something. Pat yourself on the back. The idea is to see your progress streak which gives you visual motivation and builds momentum.

If no, don't give up. List down the factors that hinder your progress and ask yourself: "What causes these factors?" Is the aim too hard? Am I being distracted? Am I lacking certain information or skill? The key is to get yourself up and running again.

### Conclusion: ###

This is a simple method to start your daily reflection habit. Questioning yourself is the key. Try doing this for a week, and you will definitely progress and gain clarity in your life.
