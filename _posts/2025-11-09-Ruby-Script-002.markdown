This simple script converts Gregorian year into Hijri year. This is just an approximate conversion.

### The Script: ###

{% highlight ruby %}
puts "Key in a Gregorian year:"

gregorian = gets.chomp.to_i

hijri = ((gregorian - 622) * 33) / 32

hijri_plus_one = hijri + 1

puts "#{gregorian} CE ≈ #{hijri} H / #{hijri_plus_one} H"
{% endhighlight %}

Example output:

{% highlight ruby %}
< Key in a Gregorian year
=>622
< 622 CE ≈ 0 H / 1 H
{% endhighlight %}

### Notes/What I Learned ###

Nothing much about ruby but more on history.

The Hijri calendar was introduced in 638 CE by Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab.

Instead of starting from the Prophet Muhammad’s birth or first revelation, it begins with a historic journey: the Hijrah, when Prophet Muhammad and his followers migrated from Mecca to Yathrib (Medina) in 622 CE.
