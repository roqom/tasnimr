Welcome to my blog! 

If you’re among the first people reading this, you’ll notice the site is still bare and minimal. It’s running on the default WordPress theme — Twenty Twenty-Five — because I just created and launched it. 

This blog is my personal public space online, where I plan to explore three things: 

### 1.Writing ###

I want to sharpen my writing skills, especially for the online world. I’ll focus more on persuasive writing — not necessarily about writing itself, but also using the skill to explore topics that interest me and help me grow as a person.

### 2.Building ###

I plan to build systems — in business and in life. To me, a system is a method for solving problems efficiently and making life smoother. My goal is peace of mind through better systems. 

### 3. Selling ### 

Eventually, I hope to earn income beyond my 9-to-5 job. So, I’ll explore how to sell something meaningful using what I learn from writing and building — in other words, entrepreneurship. Lol. 

Starting something new always brings a rush of excitement and wanting to do many things— and that’s exactly where I am right now. I’m still figuring things out. But I believe that if I keep showing up and writing consistently, I'll find what to focus on, InsyaAllah. 

As I continue, I’ll add more features or update the design if needed. But for now, I enjoy this minimalist look and feel. 

Oh, one more thing — if you’re on Facebook, feel free to add me as friend or follow me for updates. Here's my profile: [https://www.facebook.com/roq0m](https://www.facebook.com/roq0m).

Thanks for being here 😊
