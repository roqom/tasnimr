Hello world.

This is my first script. Well, not exactly the first— I've written a few basic Ruby scripts, but they are mostly from the examples and exercises from the book Learn to Program by Chris Pine.

This time round, I want to synthesize what I've learned from the book by writing  more scripts and creating my own small projects. 

Anyway, this first script is pretty basic and nothing fancy. You enter the hours, and the program will return the number in minutes.

### The Script: ###

{% highlight ruby %}
puts "Please enter how many hours:"

hours = gets.chomp.to_i

in_minutes = hours * 60

puts "#{hours} hrs => #{in_minutes} mins"
{% endhighlight %}

Example Output:

{% highlight ruby %}
< Please enter how many hours:
=>3
< 3 hrs => 180 mins
{% endhighlight %}

### Notes/What I Learned ###

Remember to convert gets.chomp into number by using the method to_i. Otherwise the program couldn't multiply by the number 60. By default gets.chomp will return the value as string.
