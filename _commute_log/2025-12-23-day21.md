I've always been wondering why do people, particularly scholars and rulers, of the 7th or 8th century were so concern on the concept of qadr.

The concept of qadr is about whether human being has free will or whatever he does is determined and controlled by God.

As a person who lives in the post modern era and now the age of AI, I don't see the significant impact of such concept. I mean, generally, whether you believe free will or not, as long as you don't hurt others or commit crimes then we're good. 

But those people back then are so concern about this idea of qadr that they even split into groups Some even were back by the ruling party at the time. 

At that time, the ruling party champion the view that human doesn't has free will and everything is being determined and controlled by God.

And that is the answer to my question. It's all boil downs to political power. Having the no free-will worldview, the ruling party can do anything they like, even commiting injustice, and simply said: "It is the will of God."

If today big data gives power to a ruling party, then back then it is the endorsement of a certain philosophy or theology that gives them power to rule.
