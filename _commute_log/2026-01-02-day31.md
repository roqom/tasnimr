I need to learn to pay attention to time and occasions. There is always something to say, wish, hope, or pray for others at certain times or milestones.

For example, today is my son’s first day of school as a nursery kid. I should have prayed for him and wished him well. But I wasn’t aware of this, and to me, it was just another day of going to school (previously he was in pre nursery).

Another example: I met my neighbour when I was 
just about to leave my house. So I just said hello. She said hello back and mentioned that she hoped she hadn’t disturbed me and my family with her recent house renovation. We talked about the renovation as we took the lift and went down. Afterwards, she said “Happy New Year” — and in my mind I was like, oh yes, it’s the new year.
