I need to learn to pay attention to time occasions. There's always something to say, wish, hope or pray at a certain time or milestone.

For example today is my son's first day of school as a nursery kid. I should  pray and wish him well. But I wasn't aware of this and to me, it was just another day of going to school.

Another example was I met my neighbor when I was just about to leave my house. So I just said  hello. She said hello back and told me that she hope she didn't disturb me and my family about her recent house renovation.
