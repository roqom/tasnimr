I need to learn to pay attention to time occasions. There's always something to say, wish, hope or pray for others at a certain time or milestone.

For example today is my son's first day of school as a nursery kid. I should  pray and wish him well. But I wasn't aware of this and to me, it was just another day of going to school.

Another example was I met my neighbor when I was just about to leave my house. So I just said  hello. She said hello back and told me that she hope she didn't disturb me and my family about her recent house renovation. So we talk about the renovation as we took the lift and went down. Afterwards she said happy new year- and in my mind was like "oh yes it's new year"
