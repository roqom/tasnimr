This is a general guard-rail thinking guidelines for careful, non-overreaching writing. It doesn't mean you need to apply all.

1. Claim Weight Check

Ask: "If this sentences is taken seriously, what does it force me to believe next?"

2. Scope Fence

Ask: "Did I just speak about this case, or all cases"

3. Description vs Reality

Ask: "Am I describing how we speak, or what exists?"

4. Reader Hostility Test

Ask: "How could this sentence be used against me?"

5. Balance Signal

Ask: "Have I acknowledged what this framework gains, not only what it costs?"

6. Redundancy Test 

Ask: "Is this repetition doing conceptual work, or just repeating?"

7. Final Art Check

Ask: "Have I guarded the idea without strangling the voice?" Does it sound too mechanical, over qualified, lifeless?
