If you feel overwhelmed in life, the best activity to begin with is walking. Don’t think about jogging, running, or brisk walking. Just walk normally. But walk for 20 minutes every day.

Why 20 minutes? Because it’s enough time to gently raise your heart rate and still be manageable. More importantly, it’s something most of us can commit to consistently.
