I have been learning about SQLite lately.
SQLite is a simple database system that doesn’t require a server unlike other databases. It is essentially a file, and it stays wherever your application is.

When you install SQLite, you are installing a library, not an application. This library, which is written in C, interacts directly with a single database file.
