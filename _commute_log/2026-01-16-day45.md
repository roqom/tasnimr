What is fast doesn’t necessarily make it efficient.

Take project work, for example. People — especially in my community — love to communicate through WhatsApp.

It’s fast and immediate, yes. But things often get messy. There’s no clear source of truth, no proper trail to follow, and accountability becomes blurry. Messages get drowned by newer ones, and tasks are missed. That isn’t efficiency.

The same pattern appears with technology (and in many other areas). This people tend to be conservative and comfortable with the status quo. WhatsApp and email are their default tools, so they use them to coordinate everything.

Exploring better tools or better ways of working feels like extra effort— and to some I would say lazy. Thus speed is mistaken for effectiveness.
