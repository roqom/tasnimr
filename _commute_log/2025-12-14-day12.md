You should be prepared to whom you shall share your passwords and how to when you're gone. Here's why:

1. The person can access your important digital accounts like your phone and email without the need to go through all the legal stuff.

2. The person doesn't have to force and break your stuff.

3. The person can delete files, data, or accounts that you want them to be gone.

4. The person can maintain the services you use, for example your website.

5. The person can help to announce in your social media that you have gone.
