When organizing things in a physical space, you need to consider the easiness to retrieve a thing and to keep it back. Especially the things that you use regularly.

A room may seem neat and tidy at first. But if there is no seamless way to retrieve and keep a thing, it will become clutter again.

When you are tired or you are in a low mood, you don't want to deal with keeping things tidy. And when keeping a thing requires multiple steps, you just want to toss it somewhere and deal with it later. But eventually things will begin to pile up. And you are back with the mess.

That's why easiness in organizing is important. Even if you are feeling down for the day, and you need to keep a thing, you can still deal with it and keep you place tidy.
