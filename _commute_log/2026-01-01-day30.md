When organizing things in a physical space, you need to consider how easy it is to retrieve a thing and to put it back. Especially the things that you use regularly.

A room may seem neat and tidy at first. But if there is no seamless way to retrieve and put a thing back, it will become cluttered again.

When you are tired or in a low mood, you don’t want to deal with keeping things tidy. And when putting a thing back feels troublesome, you will likely leave it out instead.

So maybe good organization is not about being neat, but about making it easy enough that you still do it even when you don’t feel like it.
