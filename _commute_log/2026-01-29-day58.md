If you’ve ever taken the LRT from Punggol, you know how small it is.

With the growing number of residents here, I still don’t get why they keep sending a one-cabin LRT. Sometimes they send two. Sometimes. Honestly, just send two all the time, especially during peak hours.

This morning, on my way to work, it was one cabin. The funny thing is there were four wheelchair users trying to board. So everyone had to squeeze in. And those motorised wheelchairs take up a lot of space.

No blame on them.

But the situation felt unnecessary. Punggol isn’t new anymore. Crowded mornings aren’t unexpected.
