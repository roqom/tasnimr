If you ever took the LRT from Punggol, you know how small the thing is. With the increasing number of residents in Punggol, I still don't get it why they still send one cabin LRT. At times they sent two cabins. I mean please just send two always especially during crowded times.

Today was one cabin LRT when I going to work. The funny thing is, somehow, there are 4 wheelchair people trying to board the LRT. so everyone has to squzee in. And you know that motor wheelchair which is bulky and take lots of space
