Generally, I tend to lean towards minimalism in life. Whether in design, aesthetic, traveling, wearables, relationship, etc I operate under the principle "less but better".  Minimalism values simplicity, essentials, necessary, light-weight. However I realized this can be dangerous when taken too far into the realm of metaphysics.

Applying minimalism in metaphysics basically means being prudent or cautious about bloating/inflating ontology based on language. This is semantic minimalism; and this is the principle which Mu'tazila's framework is built upon.

using the Mu'tazila framework,
we will constantly ask:

1- Is it necessary to map a particular word to a reality?
2- Can we maintain simplicity in reality without the need to multiply?
3- Can we just maintain some words at linguistic branch without commiting and pushing towards reality to make sure it's ontologically clean and neat?

At the outset Mu'tazila's framework seems beautiful, simple and sophisticated, at least for me. But in metaphysics, this will lead to lots of issue or "bugs", among the famous ones:

1- Maintaining God as essence without attributes 
2- Quran as a creation

All those issues, causes a fork in the framework which the Ashari later came and eloquently solve them. It is the Ashari framework that I came to realized when there's a need to maximize things you must maximize. And when there's a need to minimize, you minimize. The Ashari is all about moderation and putting things where it is due. It is the balance between minimalism(Mu'tazila) and maximalism(Anthropomorphism) in ontology.
