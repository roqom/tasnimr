I’m currently reading one of India’s most famous works, the Bhagavad Gita, translated into English by Eknath Easwaran. The book begins in the setting of a war, where Arjuna is confused about how to proceed. In his despair, he seeks the advice and wisdom of his charioteer, Krishna.

The first thing Krishna speaks about is knowing what is Real and knowing one’s true self. What is ultimately real, Krishna says, is that which is permanent.

Without this understanding, we move through life operating on a framework of division and separation. We attach ourselves to false identities—this idea of “I” and “mine.” And from this misidentification comes confusion, conflict, and suffering.
