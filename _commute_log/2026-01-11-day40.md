I'm currently reading one of India famous work which is the Bhagavad Gita translated in English by Iswaran. The book started in a war setting where Arjuna is confused on how to proceed so he seek the advice and wisdom of his charioteer, Krishna.

The first thing that came from Krishna is about knowing what is Real and your true self. What is ultimate real is permanent.

Not knowing this, we operate in life on the framework of division or separation. We associate ourselves to false identity of "I". This is the cause of all confusion and conflict in life.
