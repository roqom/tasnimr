I'm currently reading one of India famous work which is the Bhagavad Gita translated in English by Iswaran. The book started in a war setting where Arjuna is confused on how to proceed so he seek the advice and wisdom of his charioteer, Krishna.

The first advice that came from Krishna is about knowing the Reality. Your true self. What is ultimate real is permanent.
