I wrote about stabilizing your nervous system in one of commute logs.

The idea is that when you are at a low point of your life in terms of energy and productivity level, the first step is to stabilize your nervous system.

If you find you have lost trust on yourself, no motivation, low self-esteem, always lying down on bed, always sleepy even after hours of sleep, no drive to achieve yours goals in life, anxiety, indulging in unhealthy and sinful activities to cope, then the first step is not to add more load onto your nervous system.
