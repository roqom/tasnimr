It's not that I lack of topics to write about, but I find it hard to expand on a topic.

There are many things to write about, and they don't have to be revolutionary or hook kind of topics. 

A simple topic will do, like:
- Why are trees green?
- How does Ruby become a web application
- What is HTTP/S
- Who invented the idea of 9-5

Plus I don't have to write thousand-words essay. Just 250 to 300 words is good enough to begin.

So why do I still struggle to write? Maybe I haven't put much thought on the topics I want to write. I mean I have a sweeping ideas here and there, sort of half baked ideas.
