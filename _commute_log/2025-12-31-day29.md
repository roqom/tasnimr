It’s not that I lack topics to write about, but I find it hard to expand on a topic.

There are many things to write about, and they don’t have to be revolutionary or hook-driven topics.

A simple topic will do, like:
- Why are trees green?
- How does Ruby become a web application?
- What is HTTP/S?
- Who invented the idea of the 9–5 work system?

Plus, I don’t have to write a thousand-word essay. Just 250 to 300 words is good enough to begin.

So why do I still struggle to write?

Maybe I haven’t put much thought into the topics I want to write about. What I usually have are sweeping, half-baked ideas scattered here and there about a topic.

This made me realize that writing is thinking. You need to question the topic and think about how to answer it. As a beginner, you don’t have to think too deeply, nor do you have to be accurate. What you need to do is to put your mind to work on a topic — to at least put a little bit more effort in thinking.
