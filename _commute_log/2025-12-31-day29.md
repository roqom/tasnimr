It's not that I lack of topics to write about, but I find it hard to expand on a topic.

There are many things to write about, and they don't have to be revolutionary or hook kind of topics. 

A simple topic will do, like:
- Why are trees green?
- How does Ruby become a web application
- What is HTTP/S
- Who invented the idea of 9-5

Plus I don't have to write thousand-words essay. Just 250 to 300 words is good enough to begin.

So why do I still struggle to write?

Maybe I haven't put much thought on the topics I want to write. What I have is usually a sweeping, half bake ideas here and there about a topic

This made me realize that writing is thinking. You need to question the topic, and think how to answer them. You don't have to be thinking so deep nor you have to be accurate. At the beginning it's about to put your mind to work on a topic, to at least think.
