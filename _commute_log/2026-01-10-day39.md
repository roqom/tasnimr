So it's coming to 40 days where I have been writing every day.

Are there any improvement? I don't know. I still feel words still not flowing properly. I'm not trying to get my first write to be polish. At the least, by now, I aim to have the words to flow better. 

if you ask me to read I can know most the meaning of the words. But why when I try to write, most of the vocab are gone and the syntax becomes awkward?

Maybe 40 days of writing is still not enough time to see the improvement. Maybe another 5 months more? Maybe I should add a different writing practice?
