So it’s coming to 40 days of writing every day.

Is there any improvement? I don’t know. I still feel that the words are not flowing properly. I’m not trying to make my first draft polished. At the very least, by now, I was hoping the words would flow better.

When I read books, I can understand most of the words and their meanings. But when I try to write, the vocabulary seems to disappear, and the syntax becomes awkward.

Maybe 40 days of writing is still not enough to see improvement. Maybe I need another five months. Or maybe I should add a different kind of writing practice?
