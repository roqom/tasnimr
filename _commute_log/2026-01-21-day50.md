Most of us already know what we should do to live a fulfilling and positive life. And we also know what leads to disappointment and resentment.

That’s why knowing alone is not enough.If it were, everyone would be living on cloud nine. But reality clearly says otherwise.

Action, on its own, is also unsustainable. Most of us act only when we feel motivated—and motivation comes and goes. We can’t rely on it.

Yet action is still necessary if we want a good life.
So what can action rely on? Philosophy.

Philosophy is your mindset toward the small things.

We already know what makes life meaningful. Those things are often simple. There is no arcane knowledge required. Everything we need is already in books and on the internet.

What we really need is to train our mind to value and commit to the small things.
