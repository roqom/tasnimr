Most of us know what we must do to lead a life of fulfilment and positivity. And we also know what we need to do to avoid a life of disappoinment and resentment.

That's why knowing is not enough otherwise every one will be on cloud nine. But reality doesn't reflect that. 

Action is also unsustainable. Most of us do things when we fill motivated. We can't rely on it as it comes and goes. Yet we need action to achieve a good life. And what is the thing an action can rely on? It is Philosophy. 

It's your mindset of the small things. We know what it takes to be happy and meaningful. And those activities are simple. There is no secret knowledge. Everything you need to know is there in books and on the internet.
