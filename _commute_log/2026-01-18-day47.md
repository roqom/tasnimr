Yesterday is the first time I skipped writing for Commute Log.  In fact, I skipped walking in the morning and skipped reciting the Quran.

I was so sleepy and tired yesterday that I just want to lay on my bed and sleep. But I got class to teach in the morning and class to attend in the afternoon. Saturday is the day I most dreaded. not the teaching part.
