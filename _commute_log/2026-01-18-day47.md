Yesterday was the first time I skipped writing for Commute Log.In fact, I skipped my morning walk and didn’t recite the Quran either.

I was so sleepy and tired that all I wanted was to lie on my bed and sleep. But I had a class to teach in the morning and another class to attend in the afternoon. Saturday is the day I dread the most.
Not because of the teaching part.
