Is blogging still relevant in the age of AI?

The numbers show that blog traffic is increasing, even more so now (2025) than ever before.

This is interesting because, despite social media, YouTube, short videos, AI, and our increasingly short attention spans, blogs are still alive—at least according to the numbers.

Not just any kind of blog, though. It seems to be the in-depth kind that continues to matter. Usually, these are long-form blogs with a lot of thought put into them.

AI still searches for this kind of writing, outputs answers based on it, and sometimes even indicates the source.

Maybe blogging today is less about reach, and more about becoming a reliable source for both humans and machines.
