Is blogging still relevant in the age of AI?

The numbers show that blog traffic is increasing more so now(2025) than ever.

This is interesting because even with social media, YouTube, short video, AI, plus our short attention span, blog is still alive according to the numbers.

Not any kind of blog though. It's more to the in-depth kind of blog. Usually those are long written blog with much thought put into it.

AI still search for those kind of blog, output the answer, and sometimes indicate the source.
