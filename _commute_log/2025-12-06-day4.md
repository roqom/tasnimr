I don't have many ideas to talk about. When you ask me about my opinion about something, I can give you one or two sentences. Beyond that I don't know what to talk about. The thing is, I love to read, and I read a lot. Most of the books I read falls under the categories of philosophy, self-help, or computer related. Yet with all those years spent reading, I still have trouble putting words on what I have read and learnt.

Am I even learning in the first place? Does my mind take in the knowledge and information? If so, why am I struggling to articulate? Ok, if taking in knowledge is hard enough for me, what about sentence structure? Why am I still not tuning in to basic grammar syntax? Basic style? Where did all the words go? 

After all the years, mistake after mistake after mistake. Is my mind still working?
