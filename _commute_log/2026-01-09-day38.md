You need to judge a book by its cover. Especially in this day and age where people like to potray themselves in social media.

You need to judge people.You need to know what is wrong and what is right. We are human and human is a rational animal thus we must exercise our judgement.

Judge people by their character, the way they speak, the way they dress, and their social media postings.

This outward appearanceis a reflection of their inner being.

Don't be to quick to believe that someone is successful or has repented based on their postings.

Use the syariah and it's principles as your yardstick.
