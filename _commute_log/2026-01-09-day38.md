You need to judge a book by its cover—especially in this day and age, where people like to portray themselves in certain ways on social media.

You need to judge people. You need to know what is wrong and what is right. We are human, and humans are rational animals; thus, we must exercise judgment.

Judge people by their character, the way they speak, the way they dress, and their social media postings.

These outward appearances are often a reflection of their inner being.

Don’t be too quick to believe that someone is successful or has truly repented based solely on what they post.

Use syariah and its principles as your yardstick to spot fakery.

Know the concept of istidraj.
