Recently, the website of a newly launched restaurant crashed due to huge amount of people coming in to book a slot.

The problem is not the high amount of traffic, but how the website, particularly the server, handle the simultaneously onslaught of bookings.

What I heard is that the website runs on edge server using Vercel. This makes me question why run on edge server if you are handling bookings with big traffic?

To me, for this kind of case it is best to run on a backend server with a strong database and a proper configuration of NGINX.
