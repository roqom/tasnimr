I found this open source Android App in F-Droid called GitNote. You write your notes in plain text, whether in txt or markdown, and the app will automatically initialize and commit each note you edit and save in your internal storage directory or the app directory. You can also push to your remote repository like GitHub.

I like this concept because
1- I'm learning about Git so writing my notes in this way helps me to get used with doing Git
2- The notes are in plain text so they don't depend on any proprietary application or company. 
3- I can backup my notes in Git and outside of my local machine.

However I can't seem to find the documentation for GitNote, and you have to configure how to properly use it especially connecting to your remote repository.
