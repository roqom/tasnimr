I wish I have the freedom and courage to travel anytime I want and not being tied to the modern work culture and the never ending chasing of money.

I'm not saying that modern work is totally bad, but I wish I can find an alternative route to earn a living that doesn't take most of my time and energy for rest of my life.

I wish I can spend most of that time and energy to build things, to read great books, to write on my blog, to spend quality time with family and friends, and to travel to places I like -- all without the need to seek approval from another human being. A human who doesn't really care about your well being at the end of the day.
