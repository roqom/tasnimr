I wish I have the freedom and courage to travel anytime I want and not being tied to the modern work culture and the never ending chasing of money.

I'm not saying that the modern work is totally bad, but I wish I can find an alternative route to earn a living that doesn't take most of my time and energy.

I wish I can spend most of that time and energy to build things, to read good books, to spend quality time with family and friends, and to travel to places I like all without seeking approval from another human being.

A human who doesn't really care about your well being at the end of the day
