What is a sign of maturity of a person?

Physically, it is when a person reach puberty. But I don't mean maturity in that sense. What I mean is more to a behavioral sense.

To me maturity is the ability to acknowledge one's emotions without being reactive to impulses. The ability to make the best decision based on good judgement. And that requires knowledge of the proper places of things.
