What is a sign of maturity of a person?

Physically, maturity begins at puberty. But I don't mean maturity in that sense. What I mean is more to a behavioral sense.

To me maturity is the ability to acknowledge one's emotions while choosing not to act on every impulse. The ability to make the best decision based on good judgement. And that requires knowledge of the proper places of things.
