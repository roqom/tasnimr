What is a sign of maturity in a person?

Physically, maturity begins at puberty. But that’s not the kind of maturity I mean. I’m referring to maturity in a behavioral sense.

To me, maturity is the ability to acknowledge one’s emotions while choosing not to act on every impulse. It is the ability to make decisions based on sound judgment, and that requires knowing the proper place of things.
