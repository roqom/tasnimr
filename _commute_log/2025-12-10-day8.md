I'm finally starting to have a good understanding of Git. Previously, I knew Git as a sort of backup and version controlling system for your project in a directory. But I still didn't get the concept and how to use it. Like what is a commit? What's the link with GitHub? How do I copy the files from remote repository to my local? And so on

What finally made me clicked was reading the book  Learning Git by Anna Skoulikari, building static site blog that pull from Github, and just tinkering with GitHub and Git in the command line.

Actually when I read the book Learning Git and did the excersices for the first time I still didn't quite get the concept. It is the combination of reading and experimenting that made me understood.

Now I'm going through the book the second time.
