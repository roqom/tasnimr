I need to start thinking about what happen if I die. Have I prepared my will for my kids? Am I ready to face Eternity? Did I fulfill my responsibility? Did I lead a meaningful life, one that is worth bringing to the afterlife?

If you ask me now, definitely the answer is no. I'm not prepared. I've done lots of mistake and wasted most of my time.

This is the scariest thing: going through life in heedlessness and thinking you will live forever.

Well I need to wake up and put my life back on track. I should put death the center of everything that I do and every decision that I make. Don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting myself to be morbid. It's more towards the positive side, one that priorities true and everlasting happiness.

To kick of, I'm going to start with my will like what to do if I die. This include how they can retrieve my credentials for important accounts.
