Today I met my old schoolmate to discuss purchasing an HDB flat. My situation is a bit different because my wife has just sold her condo. At this stage, I need to write an appeal letter to be exempted from the 15-month waiting time and the 30-month grant restriction.

Besides advising me on housing, he talked about life and about being brave enough to venture outside the 9-to-5 job. Somehow, when he spoke, something clicked in me. I don’t know what it is.

Hope?
Courage?
YOLO?
Give your best?

Maybe it’s just a reminder that this stage of life is asking something from me.
