Today I met my old schoolmate to discuss purchasing an HDB flat. My situation is a bit different because my wife has just sold her condo. At this stage, I need to write an appeal letter to be exempted from the 15-month waiting time and the 30-month grant restriction.

Besides advising me on housing, he talked about life and about being brave enough to venture outside the 9-to-5 job. Somehow, when he spoke, something clicked in me. I don’t know what it is.

Hope?
Courage?
YOLO?
Give your best?

He kept saying we are at our prime age and we can do more. Have faith in God.

Maybe it’s just a reminder that this stage of life is asking something from me.
