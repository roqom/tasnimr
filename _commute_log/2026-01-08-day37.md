Today I met my old school mate to discuss about purchasing a HDB flat. My situation is a bit different cause my wife just sold her condo. So at this stage, I need to write an appeal letter to be exampted from the 15-month waiting time and also the 30-month grant thing. 

Beside advising about housing, he talked about life and being brave to venture things outside of the 9-5 job. Somehow when he talked it clicks something in me. I don't what it is. Hope? Courage? YOLO? Give your best.
