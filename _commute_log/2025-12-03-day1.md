I have always been fascinated by the World Wide Web. My interest began in my teenage years, when I first discovered the blogosphere. It is not just about publishing your ideas to the world, but also being able to customize the look of your site.

My interest started to go deeper when I discovered WordPress. I wanted to know how the blog system works: like how does WordPress pull all of my posts from the admin dashboard and present them nicely to the front look follwing a parcticular theme?

That's where I learnt about database, particularly MySQL which is where WordPress stores all of your posts and media.
