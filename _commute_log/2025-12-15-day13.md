You can now find some of my writings for Commute Log over at my blog [tasnimr.com/commute-log](https://tasnimr.com/commute-log). Slowly, I'm migrating all of my writings from Google's Keep Notes to my blog's remote repository in GitHub. 

This is better because now (1)my writings is in plain text format and (2)Netlify can instantly pull my updated repo and build my blog.

I also managed to create a dedicated page which shows only Commute Log posts. I'm using Jekyll to build my personal website. So to create such page, this is generally what you need to do:

1- Create a directory in your Jekyll site's project folder. So in my case I created _commute_log for all the posts related to it.

2- Add collection in the _config.yml
 Example:

{% highlight YML %}
collections:
  commute_log:
    output: true
    permalink: /commute-log/:name/
    
defaults:
  - scope:
      path: ""
      type: commute_log
    values:
      layout: post
{% endhighlight %}

3- Create the listing page: commute-log.md (or .html)
