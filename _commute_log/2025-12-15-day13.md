You can now find some of my writings for Commute Log over at my blog tasnimr.com/commute-log. Slowly, I'm migrating all of my writings from Google's Keep Notes to my blog's remote repository in GitHub. This is better because now my writings is in plain text format and I can instally update my blog.

I also managed to create a dedicated page which shows only Commute Log posts. I'm using Jekyll to build my personal website. To create such page, you need to do the following generally:

1- Create a directory in your Jekyll site's project folder. So in my case I created _commute_log for all the posts related to it.

2- Add collection in the _config.yml
