I think I should start to write a short 250-to-350-words informal essay for my blog. I will use the term atomic essay for this. Maybe I wil start by writing once a month.


If Commute Log is a spontaneous unstructured note, then atomic essay will be a more structured and organize writing. This will force me to think a little bit harder which is good mental exercise.

Now comes the problem what shall I write about? How do I generate ideas and topics to write about?
