I think I should start writing short, informal essays of around 250 to 300 words for my blog. I will use the term atomic essay for this. Maybe I will start by writing one once a month.

If the Commute Log is a spontaneous, unstructured note, then an atomic essay would be a more structured and organized form of writing. This will force me to think a little harder, which is a good mental exercise.

Now comes the problem: what should I write about? How do I generate ideas and topics to write about?
