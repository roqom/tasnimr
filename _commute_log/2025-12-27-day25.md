I'm so tired today. Like I just want to sleep the whole day. 

I'm always feeling sluggish. 

I'm not in a good shape.

I know I should start eat ealthy and exercise. But I don't know where to start.

I mean I know what I'm supposed to do. It's just that I find hard to sustain a good habit.

Many times I trid to exercise, simple as walking 10 minutes every day. Still I couldn't sustain.
