The thing about skipping a day is that it makes skipping the next one easier. That’s the part I hate the most.

You start to lose momentum, and once momentum is gone, everything feels heavier than it should.

So the real task is not perfection, but finding a way to get back on track as quickly as possible. Because the longer you stay off track, the harder it feels to return.
