Even though I'm into minimalism and simplicity, my room is still in a mess. There will always be a pile of clothes on the floor next to my bed and on the chair, my son's unwashed milk bottle, books and plush toys scattered on the bed, unsorted things on the working desk. On top of that, my room is dusty.

The problem is there are too many stuff. This  small room is shared between me and my wife and my two kids. Another problem is we don't - ok I don't - find the time to clean and sort the stuff.
