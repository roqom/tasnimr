I almost forgot to write for Commute Log today. Today is Thursday and I'm supposed to be working, but I decided to use my Child Sick Leave since my daughter got 3 days MC.

So here I am at home on my bed thinking should I dive in WordPress development, or continue learning Ruby and it's web frameworks, or learn Kotlin.

Not again.
