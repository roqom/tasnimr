Okie dokie.

Where do I start?

I know I have skipped a few days in writing for Commute Log. I was writing one yesterday, but got digressed when I receive messages from work.

It's about this stupid last minute auditing exercise. 

Anyway, let's not talk about that. 

Maybe I give some updates in point form.

- The API for PrayerTimesSG is almost done. I just need to host it online.
