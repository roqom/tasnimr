Okie dokie.

Where do I start?

I know I’ve skipped a few days of writing for Commute Log. I was actually writing one yesterday, but got digressed when I received messages from work.

It was about a stupid, last-minute auditing exercise.

Anyway, let’s not talk about that. This log deserves better energy.

Maybe I’ll just give some updates in point form.

- The API for PrayerTimesSG is almost done. I just need to host it online. I’ve already provisioned the server and domain at api.prayertimes.sg. Next step is to upload the API scripts and files. It’s nice to feel something move forward, even when the days feel messy.

- Met Adi yesterday for a cup of coffee at #diff. Yes, the name of the café is #diff. It’s located near Bendemeer MRT station. We also met Khai there—it’s actually part of his café, and he helps build the business and concept. Adi and I talked a bit about Larut. It was one of those conversations that didn’t lead anywhere specific, but still felt grounding.

- On Sunday, we brought the kids to East Coast to meet Os’ family and Adi’s family. Let the kids play outdoors in the sand. Watching them play felt like a quiet reset.

That’s about it for now.
