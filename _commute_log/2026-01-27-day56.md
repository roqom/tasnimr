Okie dokie.

Where do I start?

I know I have skipped a few days in writing for Commute Log. I was writing one yesterday, but got digressed when I receive messages from work.

It's about this stupid last minute auditing exercise. 

Anyway, let's not talk about that. 

Maybe I give some updates in point form.

- The API for PrayerTimesSG is almost done. I just need to host it online. I have provisioned its server and domain which is at api.prayertimes.sg. Next is to upload the API scripts and files.

- Met Adi yesterday for a cup of coffee at #diff. Yes the name of the cafe is #diff. It's located near Bendemeer MRT station. And we met Khai there. It's part of his cafe actually. He helps to build the business for the coffee and concept kind of thing. So Adi and I talked about Larut little bit.

- Sunday we brought the kids to East Coast to meet Os family and Adi family. Let the kids play outdoor with sand.
