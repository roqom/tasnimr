When a person is usually late, no matter how you adjust the time, they will probably still be late. And they will almost always have a justification for it.

But what makes this group consistently late?
Maybe they don’t plan their time well. Maybe they don’t take being on time seriously. Or maybe they don’t feel the psychological effects of always being late.

What are those psychological consequences?

1. Chronic guilt and low self-respect
2. Increased anxiety and stress
3. Procrastination
4. Damage to identity (“This is just who I am”)
5. Strained relationships and subtle social rejection
6. Loss of agency and life direction

Always being late slowly teaches your mind that you are unreliable, and living with that belief is heavier than missing any appointment.
