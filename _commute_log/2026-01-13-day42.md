When a person is usually late, no matter how you adjust the time, they will probably still be late.  And they will always have a justification for why they are late.

But what makes this group always being late? Maybe they don't plan their time well. Or maybe they don't take being on time seriously. They don't feel they psychological effects of being always late.

What are the psychological consequences? 

1- Chronic Guilt and Low Self-Respect
2- Increased Anxiety and Stress
3- Avoidance and Procrastination
4- Damage to Identity (“This Is Just Who I Am”)
5- Strained Relationships and Subtle Social Rejection
6- Loss of Agency and Life Direction

Always being late slowly teaches your mind that you are unreliable , and living with that belief is heavier than missing any appointment.
