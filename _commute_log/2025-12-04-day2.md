I thought of writing every day during my 20-minute train commute to work. If it's the weekend and I'm not working, then I will find some time in the morning to write. Nevertheless I will call this daily writing session, Commute Log. 

Commute Log is about training myself to get used to put my thoughts into sentences. This is the skill  I lack. Some say writing is a mechanical skill and if you write every day for six months - even a short and simple sentences - your writing will be better.

Commute Log is raw thoughts express in written form during small pocket of time. It's about my thought trying to find the words. Not the right words yet. So you can expect lots of error and awkwardness.
