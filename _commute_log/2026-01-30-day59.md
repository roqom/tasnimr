Besides Commute Log, I’ve started writing for the PrayerTimesSG update blog as well.

That blog is all things PrayerTimesSG, including work on api.prayertimes.sg.

For the update blog, I’m using [scribbles.page](https://scribbles.page/). It’s lightweight, no distractions, and feels just right for shipping short updates without overthinking design or setup.

The platform is built by Vincent Ritter, and honestly, I’m quite inspired by his way of building web apps. Simple, opinionated, and focused on doing one thing well. The kind of approach I want to move towards more this year.
