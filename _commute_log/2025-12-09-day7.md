After many readings, watching video tutorials, coding, experimenting with command line interface, version controlling with Git, I can say that I have a broad understanding of web technology and how it works. 

Now it is time for me to deepen my understanding and choose my area to focus. After much thought, I decided to focus on these:

1. HTML and CSS 
2. WordPress Development 

Why those? Because getting good at those areas, I can help my good friend (who is a web developer) since most of his clients are using WordPress.

Also, I think by mastering HTML CSS and WordPress development, it's quicker to build websites and to kick of my journey in web development.

Of course I don't plan to stop there. Eventually I hope to go beyond and master web app development like Ruby on Rails.
