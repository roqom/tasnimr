The past few days has been a deep one for Commute Log. Maybe I'm far from hustle and bustle of Singapore and up in the mountain of Kundasang.

I'm in a plane right now. I'm not that tired, but I'm not in a mood to write. Maybe cause it's the end of the vacation. 

Anyway, I'm going to get a Kaya Butter Coconut Toast with SANTAN's latte.
