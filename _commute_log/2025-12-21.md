The past few days has been a deep one for Commute Log. Maybe I'm far from the hustle and bustle of Singapore and up in the mountain of Kundasang.

I'm in my flight to home right now. I'm not that tired, but I'm not in a mood to write. Maybe cause it's the end of the vacation. 

Anyway, I'm going to get a Kaya Butter Coconut Toast with SANTAN's latte.
