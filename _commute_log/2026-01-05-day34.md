If you are functioning at a low energy in life, with bad habits and unhealthy activities and feeling always tired even though you have had enough hours of sleep, the first thing you need to do is not to overload yourself.

Overloading yourself can be cognitive, emotional or physical.

Stop reading self help books, or getting into another productivity hacks. Stop thinking about having goals in terms of yearly or monthly. 

what you need to do right now is stabilizing yourself and not to push yourself cause you are already broken.

Stabilizing yourself is about regulating, friction, and trust.

Regulating - start by having a good simple routine like walking 20 minutes every day at the same time. You want to build stability for your body.

Friction - create a buffer time before you engage in an unhealthy habits. Say you feel the urge of looking at adultaries, instead of giving in, pause for 10 minutes, stand up and look at the sky. At this stage the idea is not to quit but to break the auto loop by introducing friction.

Trust - high chances are at this stage, you don't even trust yourself anymore due to thousand of broken promises you made with yourself. You don't even have the motivation to strive in life. So you need restore that trust. How? my doing one activity that brings honor to yourself like reading a page of your religious text or cleaning part of your room or help your parents in something.

You do all this till you establish stabilization. You just aim small for day or at most a week. Don't create goals for the year or for the month. Just do these things. Then you will know it's time to proceed to next stage.
