If you are functioning at a low energy in life, with bad habits and unhealthy activities and feeling always tired even though you have had enough hour of sleep, the first thing you need to do is not to overload yourself.

Overloading yourself can be cognitive, emotional or physical.

Stop reading self help books, or getting into another productivity hacks. Stop thinking about having goals in terms of yearly or monthly. 

what you need to do right now is stabilizing yourself. Not to push yourself cause you are already broken.

Stabilizing yourself is about regulating, friction, and trust.

Regulating is by having a simple routine like walking 20 minutes every day at the same time.
