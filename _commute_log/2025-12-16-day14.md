How I write for Commute Log?

I write during my train commute to work. If you live in Singapore, then I write from Punggol station to Farrer Park station. The journey takes approximately 20 minutes.

In the short period available, I use an app called GitNote on my Google Pixel 9a to write down my thoughts. This app is only available to download from F-Droid.

GitNote will auto git add and auto git commit in my Commute Log working folder. If you know how to configure it well, GitNote can also auto push to your remote repository. Currently I don't.

So once I'm done writing, I use Termux to manually git push to my remote repository on GitHub. This is where my writings are stored and built upon for my blog.
